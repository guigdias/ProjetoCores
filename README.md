# ProjetoCores

Distributed REST API built with modern .NET technologies, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and orchestrated using .NET Aspire.

---

## Technologies

- .NET 8
- ASP.NET Core Web API
- MongoDB
- .NET Aspire
- Docker
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Dependency Injection
- Clean Architecture Principles

## Architecture Overview

This project follows a layered architecture based on DDD and clean separation of concerns.

## 🧠 Layer Responsibilities

### AppHost (Aspire)
- Orchestrates the distributed application
- Manages MongoDB container lifecycle
- Injects infrastructure dependencies
- Centralizes application startup

### Domain
- Contains core business logic
- Defines rich domain entities (`Color`)
- Encapsulates business rules
- Defines repository abstractions

### Infrastructure
- Implements repository interfaces
- Handles MongoDB persistence
- Contains external configurations
- No business logic

### API
- Exposes HTTP endpoints
- Handles request/response mapping via DTOs
- Depends on Domain services
- Does not contain business logic

---

## Features

- Create a color
- Update a color
- Delete a color
- List all colors
- Get color by ID
- RGB validation
- Automatic RGB → CMYK conversion
- MongoDB container managed by Aspire

---

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK installed
- Docker Desktop running

### Running the Application

```bash
dotnet run --project ProjetoCores.AppHost
```

Steps:

1. Start the AppHost project
2. Copy one of the generated localhost URLs
3. Open the URL in your browser
4. Append `/swagger` to access the API documentation

Example:

```
https://localhost:7294/swagger
```

---

## Infrastructure

- MongoDB runs as a container
- Managed automatically by .NET Aspire
- Connection string injected via configuration
- Health checks enabled

To verify MongoDB container:

```bash
docker ps
```

---

## Design Principles

- Clean Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Dependency Inversion
- Separation of Concerns
- Infrastructure isolated from Domain
- DTOs prevent direct exposure of domain entities

---

## Future Improvements

- Unit tests (xUnit / FluentAssertions)
- Integration tests
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Docker Compose production profile
- Kubernetes deployment
- Authentication & Authorization
- Logging and Observability improvements
